This is an implementation of this research paper : https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221506334_Outlier_Detection_with_Kernel_Density_Functions/link/54b6a2d80cf2bd04be323f49/download

*test.ipynb* shows an example of how to use this implementation.\
This version does not implement multithreaded functions.\
It will be pushed in next commits.
